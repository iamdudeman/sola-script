# TODO list

* revamp error messaging with error code -> message mapping
* support ternary operator (probably between assignment and logic_or)
    * needs new tokens "?" and ":"
* consider implementing optional chaining "?." for dealing with null conveniently
    * if so then also consider implementing nullish coalescence "??"
