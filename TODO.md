# TODO list

* support ternary operator (probably between assignment and logic_or)
    * needs new tokens "?" and ":"
* consider implementing optional chaining "?." for dealing with null conveniently
    * if so then also consider implementing nullish coalescence "??"
* protect divide by zero in binary expression interpreter
    * maybe throw an error?
    * or should it be "Infinity"
* improve how standard library code is added
    * add more to standard library
* make it easier to add custom library code
